# Vhare Robot Strategy
Below is my strategy for how the robot will win all the matches against any robot it battles

## Movement
- Use Corners robot code to move to corners at start of battle, and look for a robot to attack
- Once robot detect Use Tracker robot to attack robot and fire


## Defence

- if we get by a bullet turn and move perpendicular to the bullet to seesaw
